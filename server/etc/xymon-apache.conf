    # Password file where users with access to these scripts are kept.
    # Although expected in $XYMONHOME/etc/ by the useradm and chpasswd
    # scripts, files here can be read with the "config" message type, 
    # which allows status-privileged clients to read arbitrary regular files 
    # from the directory. 
    # 
    # This file should be owned and readable only by the apache server user,
    # and ideally merely a symlink to a location outside of $XYMONHOME/etc/
    # 
    # Create it with:
    #	htpasswd -c /home/xymon/server/etc/xymonpasswd USERNAME
    #	chown apache:apache /home/xymon/server/etc/xymonpasswd
    #	chmod 640 /home/xymon/server/etc/xymonpasswd
    # Add more users / change passwords with: "htpasswd /home/xymon/server/etc/xymonpasswd USERNAME"
    #
    # You can also use a group file to restrict admin access to members of a
    # group, instead of anyone who is logged in. In that case you must setup
    # the "xymongroups" file, and change the "Require" settings to require
    # a specific group membership. See the Apache docs for more details.
